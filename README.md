# Wordpress Start

Intented to be a jumping off point for any and all wordpress projects. Based off [Bedrock](http://roots.io/wordpress-stack/).

## Get up and Running

* Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/onedesign/ODC_wp-start.git
```

* Run composer install
```
composer install
```
This will grab wordpress from a repo and pull in our frequently used plugins
* Setup your environment
This means creating a copy of the .env.example to a .env file and filling out your information

* Set up your virtual hosts to point to path/to/project/folder/web
* Clone theme(s) into the web/app/themes folder
* Run the wordpress install by visiting your virtal host domain
* Activate your theme
